# Swish
Swish is a language designed for shell scripting and command line integration. It's heavily inspired by Go, but takes several features from classic shell scripting languages syntax so it's easier to write in interactive environments.

### Goals
- Small language syntax
- Easy to learn and write
- Embeddable
